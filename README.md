Penn LPS Coding Bootcamp 
Homework #7

This app takes user data on train schedules. It then calculates then next train time and its minutes to next arrival. 
The app calculates the values using moment.js
it then stores the data on firebase for any user to see. 


This project is useful because it can help people not miss their trains and have them saved for next time

Simply input the name of the train, its destination, its starting time and frequency and the app will calculate the rest for you
